---------- MASTER TO-DO LIST ------------

********** POUND IT/ FIST BUMP (IF TIME PERMITTING) ***********
1. Have Michael create a vision aspect for fist using the camera on the
right claw AND POINT CLOUD for DEPTH -- look for a blob that is skin
colored, return its centroid, and depth/distance from camera 
3. Rotate until object is centered (in perspective of the claw) and move
+depth and -depth

********* FOLLOW A CERTAIN COLOR BLOB ***********
0. Spawn objects of different colors into the worldi
0.2. Play with the pcl_ros demo code in c++
0.5. MICHAEL -- control the publishing by using rate = rospy.Rate(1) # 1
hertz and then rate.sleep() right after publishing
1. Write a publisher and a subscriber
2. First publish the color
3. Then listen with the subscriber for the first (centroid, area)
4. Wait for a little bit and listen in again for an updated (centroid, area)
5. Based on this, turn left/right, move forward --> WHEN DO I STOP
FOLLOWING?? WHEN DO I EXIT OUT OF THE WHILE LOOP? --Odometer?? When it has
traveled a certain amount? Or, if it sees ALL black? Like camera is
blocked.
6. In addition, if we figure out how to use the point cloud, we should have
something like "Go get the person in the red shirt" and have it go up to it,
have it say "Please follow me," and return the same way it went
